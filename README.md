## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Android/iOS emulator or real device

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/grocerymart_app.git
cd grocerymart_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app on connected device or emulator
flutter run


⚠️ Note on Testing Environment
This app was built and tested entirely on a physical Android device -- ensuring it has:


 - deployment-ready features

 - Real-world performance under actual device constraints (RAM, CPU, network)

 - Accurate rendering on real screens (vs. inflated emulator displays)

 - True behavior for animations, input fields, and gesture handling


For best results, run it on an **Android device or emulator**.

While the codebase follows Flutter best practices and is cross-platform by design, minor adjustments may be needed to run it smoothly on iOS.

> Attempting to run it directly on iOS without adjustments may lead to platform-specific issues not present on Android.
